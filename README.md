# res_pic2mri

Utilities and scripts for streamlined manual registration of intraoperative resection photographs to MRI-derived cortical models in 3D Slicer.

## Overview

This package provides helper functions and automation scripts to facilitate the registration of intraoperative resection photographs to preoperative MRI scans. It leverages FreeSurfer surfaces, 3D Slicer's visualization capabilities, and MATLAB for envelope creation to enable precise spatial mapping of surgical photographs to brain anatomy.

### Key Features

- **FreeSurfer Integration**: Surface IO and envelope handling for cortical models
- **Interactive Photo Alignment**: Manual registration tools in 3D Slicer with transform controls
- **Surface-to-Volume Projection**: Convert surface masks into volumetric representations
- **Photo Preprocessing**: Automated tools for image preparation and initial alignment
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple patients efficiently with automated loops
- **Envelope Generation**: Create brain surface envelopes for visualization

## Prerequisites

### Required Software

- **[FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/)**: For cortical surface reconstruction
  - Patient data must follow FreeSurfer's directory structure
- **[3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/) 5.8.1+**: Main visualization and registration platform
  - Tested with version 5.8.1
- **[SlicerFreeSurfer Extension](https://github.com/PerkLab/SlicerFreeSurfer)**: For FreeSurfer surface import
  - Tested with commit `05eccb9`
- **[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)**: For envelope creation
  - Required for `create_envelopes.m` script

### Python Dependencies

- Python 3.13+ (tested with Python 3.13)
- Core libraries:
  - `numpy` - Numerical computing
  - `scipy` - Optimization and image processing
  - `nibabel` - Neuroimaging file I/O
  - `matplotlib` - Visualization and interactive tools
  - `Pillow (PIL)` - Image processing
  - `PyYAML` - Configuration management
  - `tqdm` - Progress bars
  - `tkinter` - GUI file dialogs
  - `vtk` - 3D visualization (bundled with Slicer)

Additional dependencies (installed automatically when needed):
- `opencv-python` - Computer vision for auto-alignment

### Operating System

- Tested on **Windows 11**
- Should work on macOS and Linux with minor modifications to path handling

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaverschuren/res_pic2mri.git
   cd res_pic2mri
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scipy nibabel matplotlib pillow pyyaml tqdm
   ```
   
   Note: VTK and Slicer-specific modules are provided by 3D Slicer's Python environment.

3. **Install 3D Slicer**:
   - Download from [slicer.org](https://www.slicer.org/)
   - Install the SlicerFreeSurfer extension via the Extension Manager

4. **Install MATLAB** (if not already installed):
   - Required for envelope creation functionality

## Configuration

Before running the scripts, you need to configure the paths to your data and software:

1. **Copy the configuration template**:
   - The first time you run `main_slicer_loop.py`, it will create a `config.yaml` file
   - Alternatively, copy `config_template.yaml` to `config.yaml`

2. **Edit `config.yaml`** with your system paths:
   ```yaml
   slicer_exe_path: C:\Path\To\Slicer.exe
   mri_data_dir: C:\Path\To\FreeSurfer\Subjects\Directory
   pic_data_dir: C:\Path\To\Photographs\Root\Directory
   ```

   - `slicer_exe_path`: Full path to the Slicer executable
   - `mri_data_dir`: Root directory containing FreeSurfer subject folders (e.g., `RESP001`, `RESP002`, etc.)
   - `pic_data_dir`: Root directory containing corresponding photograph folders

## Usage

### Quick Start

The typical workflow consists of two main steps:

1. **Pre-compute Surface Envelopes** (Optional but Recommended):
   ```python
   python fs_envelope_loop.py
   ```
   This pre-generates envelope STL files for all patients. Without this step, envelopes are created on-the-fly, adding ~30 seconds per patient.

2. **Run Manual Registration Loop**:
   ```python
   python main_slicer_loop.py
   ```
   This opens 3D Slicer for each patient to perform manual photo-to-MRI registration.

### Detailed Workflow

#### Step 1: Envelope Generation (Optional)

Run this first to save time during the main registration process:

```python
python fs_envelope_loop.py
```

This script:
- Scans for FreeSurfer patient directories (matching `RESP*` pattern)
- Opens Slicer in no-main-window mode for each patient
- Calls MATLAB's `create_envelopes.m` to generate:
  - `lh_envelope.stl` - Left hemisphere envelope
  - `rh_envelope.stl` - Right hemisphere envelope  
  - `brain_envelope.stl` - Whole brain envelope
- Skips patients that already have envelopes

#### Step 2: Photo Registration

Run the main registration loop:

```python
python main_slicer_loop.py
```

This script:
- Loads configuration from `config.yaml`
- Finds all patient directories matching the pattern
- For each patient:
  - Locates the corresponding photograph
  - Preprocesses the image (manual drawing of resection + outside)
  - Opens 3D Slicer with:
    - T1 MRI volume
    - FreeSurfer pial surfaces (left/right hemispheres)
    - Brain envelopes
    - Textured photo plane with transform controls
  - Enables manual alignment via Slicer's transform widget
  - Allows annotation with markups curves
  - Saves registration results

### Interactive Registration in Slicer

When Slicer opens for each patient:

1. **View Setup**: The scene loads with MRI, surfaces, and the photo plane
2. **Transform Control**: Use Slicer's transform widget to align the photo:
   - Translate (move position)
   - Rotate (adjust orientation)
   - The photo appears as a textured plane in 3D space
3. **Volumetric Mask Creation**: Project the now-aligned surface mask to the underlying brain volume
4. **Export**: Save scene and volumetric resection mask

### Advanced: Auto-Alignment (Experimental)

The `optimizer.py` module includes experimental auto-alignment functionality:

```python
import optimizer
# Auto-alignment code (see optimizer.py for details)
```

⚠️ **Warning**: The auto-alignment feature is not yet stable and requires additional development before production use.

## Data Organization

### Expected Directory Structure

Your FreeSurfer subjects should be organized as:

```
mri_data_dir/
├── RESP001/
│   ├── mri/
│   │   └── T1.nii
│   └── surf/
│       ├── lh.pial
│       ├── rh.pial
│       ├── lh_envelope.stl (generated)
│       ├── rh_envelope.stl (generated)
│       └── brain_envelope.stl (generated)
├── RESP002/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Photographs should be organized with matching patient IDs:

```
pic_data_dir/
├── RESP001/
│   └── photo.jpg (or similar)
├── RESP002/
│   └── photo.jpg
└── ...
```

## Notes and Limitations

### Known Issues

- **Auto-alignment**: The automatic alignment functionality in `optimizer.py` is experimental and not yet stable. Manual alignment is recommended for production use.
  
### Performance Tips

- **Pre-compute Envelopes**: Run `fs_envelope_loop.py` first to avoid 30-second delays per patient
- **Batch Processing**: The scripts are designed for batch processing; configure all paths once and process multiple patients efficiently

### Platform Notes

- **Path Separators**: The code handles both Windows (`\`) and Unix (`/`) path separators
- **File Viewers**: Cross-platform support for image viewing (Windows Explorer, macOS Preview, Linux EOG)

### Requirements

- FreeSurfer output must include:
  - `mri/T1.nii` (or T1.mgz, will be converted)
  - `surf/lh.pial` and `surf/rh.pial`
- MATLAB with the following toolboxes:
  - Basic MATLAB (for `stlread`, array operations)
  - Image Processing Toolbox (for morphological operations)
