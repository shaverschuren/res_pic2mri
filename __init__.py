===========

Utilities and scripts for streamlined manual registration of intraoperative resection photographs to MRI-derived cortical models in 3D Slicer.

This package groups helper functions for:
- `FreeSurfer` surface IO and envelope handling
- Interactive photo plane transforms in Slicer
- Projection of surface masks into volumes
- Photo preprocessing and automatic alignment utilities
- Batch runners to open Slicer for multiple patients

Usage
-----
- The software relies on `FreeSurfer` outputs and expects subject directories to follow `FreeSurfer`'s structure.
- The main entry point is `main_slicer_loop.py`, which loops over patient directories and runs the pipeline. Adjust parameters there as needed.
- For quicker processing, run `fs_envelope_loop.py` off-line first to precompute surface envelopes (otherwise loading each patient takes ~30s).
- Most of the code is meant to be run within 3D Slicer's Python environment, which is handled automatically by the batch scripts.

Notes
-----
- The auto-alignment functionality (in `optimizer.py`) is *not* stable and requires some more work.
- The code has been tested on `Windows 11` with `Python 3.13`, `3D Slicer 5.8.1` and `SlicerFreesurfer` extension `05eccb9`.
